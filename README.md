# JSONresume

Testing out JSONresume to itemize my resume into objects that can be visualized with different HTML layouts, instead of being locked into a permanent layout forever and ever. Also, it's a good excuse to practice git shenanigans, since I spend most of my time working on my [UX Portfolio](https://jamiegray.net/software).

When completed, my resume will live at http://registry.jsonresume.org/jamiegray
